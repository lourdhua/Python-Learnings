# Python-Learnings
Advanced python concepts - Data engineering &amp; Analytics focused
This tutorial is developed based on [Python 3.10 - official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial)

## Intro
1. Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. The language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”
2. Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer.
3. Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary.
4. Python's data structure are sutable for machine learning and modern programmings.
## Potential areas where python is used
* Data Science & engineering
* Data Analytics
* Game Development
* Software engineering

Now that you are all excited about Python, you’ll want to examine it in some more detail. Since the best way to learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.

## Download and install python

***for windows OS*** visit [here](python.org) to download your file.
**dont forget to tick the `add to PATH`**

To verify your installation open CMD and type `python`, if you where able to see the REPL, then be proud of yourself... :)

***for LINUX/UNIX OS*** - you might have python already 
> any way to install python u must run `sudo apt install python3` (for debian base distros ONLY)
to verify your posetion of python simply run `python3` in terminal and u will see REPL

## Coding environment

to choose a comfortable environment you have several chices:
1. python's default IDLE(only available at windows):
  if u have installed python u can access this in your start 
2. pycharm IDLE: 
  as we know pycharm is NOT free(and this a big reason to run away...)
  any way if you decide to install pycharm you may face a big load on your RAM, you may face some problems while installing packages
3. Vscode + python3 interpreter
  Vscode is a TextEditor, which is available at [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  you can edit yot text and then run it using python interpreter
  or simpler way is too install pythonPackage in Vscode
4. Atom + python3 interpreter
  Atom is another textEditor using WIDE range of amazing tools *__*
5. Jupiterlab + python3 interpreter
  Jupiterlab is a good alternative web based textEditor. the main advantage is, it allows you to create code blocks and execute them individually. this will be much helpful in the beginning stage.
