# Using the Python Interpreter
The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.10 on those machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shellâ€™s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:
```bash
python3.10
```
to the shell. Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., /usr/local/python is a popular alternative location.)
On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the [Microsoft Store](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#windows-store), the python3.10 command will be available. 
If you have the [py.exe](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher) launcher installed, you can use the py command.
